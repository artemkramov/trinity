Forecast of time series using their segmentation based on wavelet analysis of scalogram 
 Voloshko А.V., Muzyka N.Yu. 
It is presented a methodological approach in developing models predicting time series which is in application of the properties of frequency-ordered energy coefficients of orthogonal analysis of the levels of wavelet decomposition for to identify long-term trends, seasonal and noise components. Then, it is performed a segmentation of the results of wavelet decomposition of the time series and forecast of each segment separately. Fig.: 3. Refs: 19 titles.
