A study of efficiency usage of representations for functions of hyper-complex variable 
 Kalinovsky J.A., Boyarinova Y.E. 
It is investigated the reduction of the amount of calculation when using representations for functions of hyper-complex variable such as exponent, trigonometric and hyperbolic ones as compared with their direct calculation utilizing the summation of infinite power series. Tabl.: 2. Refs: 14 titles.
