Methodics of data preprocessing in problem of sequential analysis.
Moldavskaya A.V., Ruvinskaya V.M. 
A data preprocessing technique for sequential analysis is described. It is outlined and experimentally demonstrated the problems of this field of data mining: noisy data, alphabet redundancy, eventual presence of cyclic repeats. It is proposed the solution of these problems, effectivity of which is shown experimentally. Tabl.: 6. Refs: 14 titles.
